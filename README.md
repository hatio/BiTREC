# BiTREC
Bioinformatics Tool Recommender via Cross-citation Analysis
------

The long-term goal of this project is to create a bioinformatics tool recommendation system. At current, we have gone through the methods of data gathering, pipeline recovering, and tool selection modelling. All of which relies on the already indexed tools in available tool listings (specifically Bioinformatics.ca and OmicTools.com). We aim to publish the work step by step. This repository will provide the source code used in the analyses of these publications, including ones under submission.
